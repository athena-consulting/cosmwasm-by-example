# Cosmwasm By Example 
Learning is easier by working on examples. <br>
The goal is making it easier to allow developers to start working and understanding Cosmwasm using different examples. <br>
Complexity of the examples increase gradually with initial examples made just to explain Cosmwasm basics. <br>
